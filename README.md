# Writing and Deploying a Solidity Smart Contract for Nationwide Election

### 1. Write the Smart Contract:

   - Use Solidity to create a smart contract for managing a nationwide election.
   - Implement functionalities such as voter registration, candidate nomination, voting, and result declaration.
   - Use Solidity interfaces to modularize the contract (e.g., separate interfaces for voter and candidate management).
   

### 2. Deploy on BSC Testnet:

- Set up Hardhat for smart contract development and testing.
   - Write deployment scripts to deploy the contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) testnet.
   - Use MetaMask or another wallet to interact with the deployed contract.

### 3. Write Test Cases:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests using Hardhat and Chai/Mocha.
   - Test all functionalities of the smart contract, including edge cases.

### 4. Document the Process:
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the smart contract design, deployment steps, and test cases.
